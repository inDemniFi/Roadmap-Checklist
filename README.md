# Roadmap-Checklist
This is our operational checklist for inDemniFi to illustrate our future plans and our current progress. 

### Underwriting

- [ ] Review programming languages and vulnerabilities associated with them: Research and analyze the most commonly used programming languages in the blockchain ecosystem, such as Solidity, Rust, and Vyper. Identify the known vulnerabilities and security risks associated with each language to ensure informed decision-making during protocol development.

- [ ] Explore the impact of language compilers on protocol security: Understand how language compilers translate high-level programming languages into machine-readable code and the implications they have on the security of blockchain protocols. Investigate the vulnerabilities or potential security issues introduced by different compiler technologies.

- [ ] Understand transaction risk and its implications: Evaluate the risks associated with different types of transactions within the protocol, such as token transfers, smart contract interactions, and governance actions. Assess the potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities that might arise from these transactions, considering scenarios like front-running, reentrancy, or transaction-ordering dependence.

- [ ] Evaluate auditors and their ongoing risk assessment: Identify reputable third-party auditors with expertise in blockchain security and smart contract auditing. Assess their track record, methodologies, and ongoing risk assessment practices to ensure thorough scrutiny of the protocol's codebase and security measures.

- [ ] Consider cross-exchange risk and the importance of liquidity: Analyze the potential risks associated with interactions between the protocol and external exchanges. Evaluate the liquidity risks, potential price manipulation, and the impact of market dynamics on the protocol's stability. Develop strategies to mitigate these risks and ensure robust cross-exchange interactions.

- [ ] Assess the perishability factor of protocols: Understand the risks and implications associated with protocols that are designed to have a limited lifespan or those that require regular upgrades and maintenance. Evaluate the impact of protocol upgrades on security, user experience, and compatibility with external applications or integrations.

- [ ] Examine the risk associated with protocol forking: Evaluate the potential risks and benefits of protocol forking, including hard forks and soft forks. Consider the impact on network security, decentralization, community consensus, and compatibility with existing blockchain infrastructure.

- [ ] Analyze rugpulls and their varying levels of risk: Study previous instances of rugpulls and exit scams within the blockchain ecosystem. Understand the common characteristics, warning signs, and risk factors associated with these fraudulent activities. Develop measures to mitigate the risk of rugpulls and protect users' funds.

- [ ] Study the stability of stablecoins and concentration investment risk: Assess the stability and risk factors associated with stablecoins integrated into the protocol. Analyze the collateralization mechanisms, reserves, auditing practices, and potential concentration risk arising from a high level of funds being locked in a single stablecoin.

### Rankings

- [ ] Evaluate programming languages based on features and properties: Compare different programming languages used in blockchain development based on their features, performance, security track record, community support, and ease of use. Consider factors such as static analysis tools availability, developer familiarity, and ecosystem maturity.

- [ ] Understand the role of language compilers in protocol security: Investigate how language compilers can impact the security and efficiency of blockchain protocols. Analyze the different compiler technologies available for the selected programming language and their impact on code optimization, security checks, and potential vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Assess transaction risk and its impact on overall security: Evaluate the risks associated with various types of transactions within the protocol. Consider factors such as the complexity of smart contract interactions, potential attack vectors, and the effectiveness of security measures in place. Rank the programming languages based on their ability to mitigate transaction-related risks.

- [ ] Evaluate auditors and their ongoing risk assessment: Rank third-party auditors based on their reputation, expertise, methodologies, and continuous risk assessment practices. Consider factors such as the number of successful audits, community feedback, and industry recognition. Prioritize auditors that have a proven track record in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Consider cross-exchange risk and the importance of liquidity: Rank programming languages based on their ability to address cross-exchange risks effectively. Consider factors such as compatibility with external exchanges, liquidity providers, and market-making strategies. Prioritize languages that enable secure and seamless interactions with external liquidity sources.

- [ ] Understand the perishability factor of protocols: Rank protocols based on their ability to handle upgrades and maintenance effectively. Consider factors such as backward compatibility, community support for upgrades, and clear communication channels. Prioritize protocols that can adapt to evolving security requirements and ensure a smooth transition during upgrades.

### Research

- [ ] Explore programming languages in-depth, considering features and properties: Conduct thorough research on programming languages used in blockchain development. Analyze their features, performance characteristics, security considerations, developer tooling, and community support. Consider factors like gas efficiency, smart contract language stability, and available development resources.

- [ ] Understand the role of language compilers and their impact: Investigate how different language compilers influence the security, efficiency, and performance of blockchain protocols. Explore compiler optimizations, static analysis tools, and security checks provided by each compiler technology. Consider the impact of compiler vulnerabilities on the overall security of the protocols.

- [ ] Study transaction risk during different periods, such as rush hour: Conduct research on transaction risks that may arise during periods of high network congestion or specific usage patterns. Investigate potential security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks that might affect user experience or pose security risks. Develop strategies to mitigate these risks during peak usage periods.

- [ ] Evaluate auditors and their ongoing risk assessment: Research and assess third-party auditors specializing in blockchain security and smart contract auditing. Analyze their auditing methodologies, quality assurance processes, and continuous risk assessment practices. Consider their ability to identify and mitigate emerging security threats effectively.

- [ ] Assess the Crypto Education Index and its implications: Analyze the Crypto Education Index, which provides insights into the educational resources and developer support available for various programming languages. Consider the availability of documentation, tutorials, community forums, and developer adoption trends. Use this index as a reference to understand the community support and educational resources for each language.

- [ ] Examine the perishability factor of protocols: Research and evaluate protocols that have a limited lifespan or require regular upgrades and maintenance. Analyze the challenges associated with protocol upgrades, backward compatibility, community consensus, and developer adoption. Consider the risks and benefits of protocols that prioritize innovation and evolution.
