Consider factors such as the number of successful audits, community feedback, and industry recognition. Prioritize auditors that have a proven track record in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Consider cross-exchange risk and the importance of liquidity: Rank programming languages based on their ability to address cross-exchange risks effectively. Consider factors such as compatibility with external exchanges, liquidity providers, and market-making strategies. Prioritize languages that enable secure and seamless interactions with external liquidity sources.

- [ ] Understand the perishability factor of protocols: Rank protocols based on their ability to handle upgrades and maintenance effectively. Consider factors such as backward compatibility, community support for upgrades, and clear communication channels. Prioritize protocols that can adapt to evolving security requirements and ensure a smooth transition during upgrades.

### Research

- [ ] Explore programming languages in-depth, considering features and properties: Conduct thorough research on programming languages used in blockchain development. Analyze their features, performance characteristics, security considerations, developer tooling, and community support. Consider factors like gas efficiency, smart contract language stability, and available development resources.

Explore compiler optimizations, static analysis tools, and security checks provided by each compiler technology. Consider the impact of compiler vulnerabilities on the overall security of the protocols.

- [ ] Study transaction risk during different periods, such as rush hour: Conduct research on transaction risks that may arise during periods of high network congestion or specific usage patterns. Investigate potential security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks that might affect user experience or pose security risks. Develop strategies to mitigate these risks during peak usage periods.

- [ ] Evaluate auditors and their ongoing risk assessment: Research and assess third-party auditors specializing in blockchain security and smart contract auditing. Analyze their auditing methodologies, quality assurance processes, and continuous risk assessment practices. Consider their ability to identify and mitigate emerging security threats effectively.

- [ ] Assess the Crypto Education Index and its implications: Analyze the Crypto Education Index, which provides insights into the educational resources and developer support available for various programming languages. Consider the availability of documentation, tutorials, community forums, and developer adoption trends. Use this index as a reference to understand the community support and educational resources for each language.
